### GamesDom

Created this Awesome React + Typescript website which fetches games using the RAWG api.
It's a minified version of the original RAWG website .
Used ChakraUI for the first time while developing the site. 

Site fetches the games using RAWG api and user can search for games using various filters and platforms.
It also has a Genre panel which is used to filter the games according to their genres.
Deployed on Vercel.
